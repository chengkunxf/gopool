# GoPool

GoPool is a high-performance, feature-rich, and easy-to-use worker pool library for Golang. It is designed to manage and recycle a pool of goroutines to complete tasks concurrently, improving the efficiency and performance of your applications.

## Features

- **Task Queue**: GoPool uses a thread-safe task queue to store tasks waiting to be processed. Multiple workers can simultaneously fetch tasks from this queue.

- **Dynamic Worker Adjustment**: GoPool can dynamically adjust the number of workers based on the number of tasks and system load.

- **Graceful Shutdown**: GoPool can shut down gracefully. It stops accepting new tasks and waits for all ongoing tasks to complete before shutting down when there are no more tasks or a shutdown signal is received.

- **Error Handling**: GoPool can handle errors that occur during task execution. For example, it can provide an error callback function.

- **Task Timeout Handling**: GoPool can handle task execution timeouts. For example, it can set a timeout period, and if a task is not completed within this period, the task is considered failed.

- **Task Priority**: GoPool supports task priority. Tasks with higher priority are processed first.

- **Task Result Retrieval**: GoPool provides a way to retrieve task results. For example, it can provide a result callback function.

- **Task Retry**: GoPool provides a retry mechanism for failed tasks. For example, it can set the number of retries and the retry interval.

- **Task Progress Tracking**: GoPool provides task progress tracking. For example, it can provide a progress callback function or a method to query the current task progress.

- **Concurrency Control**: GoPool can control the number of concurrent tasks to prevent system overload.
